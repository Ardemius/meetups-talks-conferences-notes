= Debrief on Devoxx France 2015

All my debriefs on Devoxx France 2015 will be added to this repo, in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] format.
As this format is natively formatted by GitHub, you just have to open the .adoc files to access the debriefs.

The others files correspond to the *slides* of the debriefs, generated by http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] and its https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends[Deck.js backend].

If you want to install those tools, https://github.com/Ardemius/asciidoctor_deckjs_POC[have a look at this POC].
