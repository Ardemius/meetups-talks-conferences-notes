Workshop du Voxxed Days Microservices, le mercredi 31/10/2018

== Description

The workshop will be done on *GKE* (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/[Google Kubernetes Engine])

*To register for the Sfeir demos*: https://goo.gl/forms/cY9HxHvsjLouF9LG3 +
-> This will allow you to benefit from SFEIR's subscription to GKE. +
This other option is to register to GKE 1 year trial period (or free 300$ of use)

The *GitHub repo* of the demos is: https://github.com/Sfeir/kubernetes-istio-workshop +

For the *explanations and instructions*, go the associated GitHub Pages: https://sfeir.github.io/kubernetes-istio-workshop/kubernetes-istio-workshop/1.0.0/index.html

NOTE: My following notes are to be read in parallel with this statement

=== Setup environment

Let's go! Informations from the *Google Cloud Platform Console*:

NOTE: I do also add my favorite https://github.com/Ardemius/personal-wiki/wiki/git-tips#useful-git-aliases[`git log` aliases]

-> Setup finished for GCP et Cloud Shell, and I'm ready to start "Part1: Kubernetes"

=== Part 1: Kubernetes

WARNING: Main folder for the doc is `~/kubernetes-istio-workshop`. +
You will NOT be in that folder after opening a new Cloud Shell!

TIP: Add `source <(kubectl completion bash)` at the end of your `.bashrc` to benefit from *kubectl completion* in all Cloud Shell.

===== Exercise: Interact with a Pod remotely

image:workshop_11.jpg[]
image:workshop_12.jpg[]

===== Exercise: View the logs of a Pod

on se met en écoute avec l'option `-f` sur le pod, et on spamme sur une autre console quelques `curl` sur le pod au travers du port que nous avons forwardé avant :

==== Monitoring and Health Checks

Kubernetes supports monitoring applications in the form of readiness and liveness probes. +
Health checks can be performed on each container in a Pod. 

* *Readiness* probes indicate when a Pod is *"ready" to serve traffic*.
	** If a readiness check fails the container will be marked as not ready and will be removed from any load balancers.
* *Liveness* probes indicate a *container is "alive"*. 
	** If a liveness probe fails multiple times the container will be restarted. Liveness probes that continue to fail will cause a Pod to enter a crash loop.

*Tutorial: Creating Pods with Liveness and Readiness Probes*

image:workshop_17.jpg[]

*Exercise: View Pod details*

image:workshop_18.jpg[]

*Quiz*

* How is the readiness of the healthy-monolith Pod determined?
	** *readiness* check in the following logs
* How is the liveness of the healthy-monolith Pod determined?
	** *healthz* check in the following logs
* How often is the readiness probe checked?
	** in _healthy-monolith.yaml_: `readinessProbe` section: `timeoutSeconds: 1` -> mais semble être 10 sec dans les logs ?! +
	-> Parce que c'est le param  `periodSeconds` qui devrait être utilisé, et comme ce n'est pas le cas dans le yaml, c'est qu'il est utilisé implicitement, avec sa valeur par défaut, qui doit donc être 10 CQFD 😉
* How often is the liveness probe checked?
	** in _healthy-monolith.yaml_: `livenessProbe` section: `periodSeconds: 15`

NOTE: The healthy-monolith Pod logs each health check. Use the kubectl logs command to view them.

And now forcing the monolith container readiness probe to pass again:

image:workshop_22.jpg[]

*Exercise: Experiment with Liveness Probes*

image:workshop_23.jpg[]

*Quiz*

* What happened when the liveness probe failed?
	** A *restart* is launched to get back to the initial state (what is shown is the previous `RESTART` column)
* What events where created when the liveness probe failed?
	** Given by `kubectl describe pods healthy-monolith`: 
+
----
Warning  Unhealthy              1m (x2 over 1m)     kubelet, gke-kube-cluster-default-pool-a6f79a8f-snmf  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503
----

[NOTE]
====
* *Readiness* : notion métier, la tâche ne peut pas rendre le service attendu car un service tiers (par exemple) ne répond pas (comme la BDD toujours par exemple)

* *liveness* : cette fois, c'est le pod lui-même qui a un problème (ou un souci de config), ce qui va entraîner son *redémarrage*
====

	** `ca.pem:      1712 bytes`

==== Advanced Route Rules

*Traffic Steering*

*Load Balancer*

image:workshop_60.jpg[]

*Rate Limiting*

image:workshop_61.jpg[]
image:workshop_62.jpg[]
image:workshop_63.jpg[]

[NOTE]
====
Confirmé avec l'équipe SFEIR, il y a un petit bug dans le script de rate limiting. +
Ce dernier ne fonctionne pas, en relançant la bouche `while` de monitoring, on ne voit aucune erreur 429 apparaître, contrairement à ce qu'indique l'énoncé.

Pour le moment, la cause du bug n'a pas été trouvée
====

==== Fault Injection

*HTTP Error 503*

image:workshop_64.jpg[]

*Delay*

image:workshop_65.jpg[]

NOTE: We see in the `while` loop than a 7sec delay now sometimes (50%) happens *before* the service is called.

*Retry*

image:workshop_66.jpg[]

* We see in the *first* `while` loop that 1 service call on 2 (1 on 2 because of the round robbin), is failing with a 503 error because targeting *recommendation-v2* pod, which we configured to fail systematically using the `127.0.0.1:8080/misbehave` special endpoint.

And now back to normal:

image:workshop_67.jpg[]

*Timeout*

image:workshop_68.jpg[]

* Just a quick watch to the way the new pod _recommendation v2_ "slow version" (777598bdc4) is replacing the old "classic" one (7bc4f7f696) +
We can simply do it by successive calls to `kubectl get pots` command

image:workshop_69.jpg[]

* In the first `while` loop, we see that there is a delay in the call to _recommendation v2_. +
But once the *timeout* is applied, we see this slowness is replaced by a: +
`customer => 503 preference => 504 upstream request timeout`

Here is the final clean up (including the deletion of the timeout rule):

image:workshop_70.jpg[]

==== Circuit Breaker

*Fail Fast with Max Connections and Max Pending Requests*

image:workshop_71.jpg[]

*Test 1: Load test without circuit breaker*

image:workshop_71.jpg[]

[NOTE]
====
There is an error in the initial command of the workshop, which uses the _lonelyplanet/siege_ Docker image: +
`docker run lonelyplanet/siege siege -r 2 -c 20 -v $CUSTOMER_URL`

This last runs a Siege v2.7.0, which is bugged (check here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=610420) +
I made a PR (https://github.com/Sfeir/kubernetes-istio-workshop/pull/11) to replace it by a new image, running a v4.0.4 Siege version, which works:

`docker run --rm funkygibbon/siege siege --version` +
`docker run --rm funkygibbon/siege siege -r 2 -c 20 -v $CUSTOMER_URL`
====

*Test 2: Load test with circuit breaker*

*Pool Ejection*

image:workshop_74.jpg[]

*Test 1: Load test without failing instances*

image:workshop_75.jpg[]

*Test 2: Load test with failing instance*

image:workshop_76.jpg[]

* Here we clearly see that, as set, only the pod _recommendation-v2-7bc4f7f696-8pntk_ is misbeaving and returns a 503 (hence, 25% of the traffic)

*Test 3: Load test with failing instance and with pool ejection*

image:workshop_77.jpg[]

*Test 4: Ultimate resilience with retries, circuit breaker, and pool ejection*

image:workshop_78.jpg[]

* Thanks to our new configuration using *circuit breaker*, *pool ejection* and *retries*, there is no more any request done to the misbehaving _recommendation-v2-7bc4f7f696-8pntk_ pod, even the initial one. +
This last is still circuit broken and pool ejected, but now a retry immediately happens to redirect the traffic to a live and ready pod.

*Clean up*

==== Mutual TLS

NOTE: For a quick reminder of what is *mutual authentication*, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication[Wikipedia].

NOTE: I didn't have time to practice this part 😜

.A good best practice about Mutual TLS in Istio
NOTE: As best practice, use a *separate port for health check* and enable mutual TLS only on the regular service port.
