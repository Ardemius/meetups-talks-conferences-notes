== Overview

====
What does GraphQL and Traditional REST API have in common? +
Shouldn't the GraphQL be connected to some graphs or similar? +
What is actually GraphQL all about?

Join me in this talk, while I try to answer all this questions and much more.

In this talk I will explain what GraphQL is, what are differences and similarities compared to more traditional REST API and show you this on working examples, since code worth more then words only ;)
====

== Notes

=== REST

* implies client-server architecture
* statelessness
* cacheability
* layered system
* Code on Demand (optional)
* *Uniform interface*

=== GraphQL

* GraphQL is a query language for APIs
* GraphQL is a specification

Vladimir uses *graphql-java* for his demo

==== Demo

* We first need a *GraphQL schema*
	** it looks like a classic POJO

.schema.graphqls

We also have the documentation for free

=== Comparison with REST

* implies client-server architecture : YES
* statelessness : YES
* cacheability : YES
* layered system : YES
* Code on Demand (optional) : YES
* *Uniform interface* : YES

-> So GraphQL is a REST API ?

* In REST, schema is optional, even if a good practise
* In GraphQL, *it is mandatory*

This point on schema is the *main difference between REST and GraphQL*

The idea behind GraphQL:

* *GraphQL*: very powerful *Query Language*

[IMPORTANT]
====
In GraphQL, "the client calls the shoots" +
They have much more power than with REST API.

* in REST, the developer fully defines everything the client will do.
* with GraphQL, a lot of things is proposed to the client: there is more flexibility for the client
====

To protect against GraphQL abuses:

* *Time out*
* *Max query depth*: to avoid a bad client to query too many data 
* *Max query complexity*

=== GraphQL query lang for API

3 parts in the language:

* query
* mutation
* subscription

2 types of resolvers:

* root resolver
* other resolvers

Not all implementations implement subscription

*In case of errors*, by example when asking a non-existing field

* Again, GraphQL *has a very rich SDL* (Schema Definition Language)
	** much more precise, compact and powerful than Swagger by example

* GraphQL has a *very powerful query lang* (even if not SQL of course)

== Avis

J'aurais préféré des slides plus détaillés (quelques labels à chaque fois).
